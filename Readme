Project for CPS 412, Effect of Chat GPT on Education and Plagarism
For this Project I worked with a team to collect data of 100 students and to find hidden patterns in the data.
It was my part of the project to build the code from scratch and provide the graphs that portayed the hidden patterns, while my team was assigned to data collection and building of the final presentation.
